# simpleConvolutionReverb
A simple convolution reverb plug-in only using one impulse response recorded myself and made in RACKAFX.
Exported the RACKAFX project to ASPiK and built it as VST3. Usable in Ableton.

Also used HiFi=LoFi's convolver object to the convolutions. [FFT Convolver](https://github.com/HiFi-LoFi/FFTConvolver)
